It can be hard to keep track of your habits in the bustle of city life. Introducing, Praxis, a webpage to help you keep track and visualize your habits. You can start new habits and see how far you’ve come along in your habit-building journey.  

## All habits can be broken down into three basic components:
### The Cue or Trigger:
 This is the part of the habit loop where you are triggered to take some sort of action through a cue in your internal or external environment.
### The Action:
 Good or bad, this is the part of the habit loop where you actually take action on the habit you want to adopt or drop.
### The Reward:
 This is the part of the habit loop where your brain receives a reward for taking the desired activity (or not as you will see in just a second).

On average, it takes more than 2 months before a new behavior becomes automatic — 66 days to be exact. And how long it takes anew habit to form can vary widely depending on the behavior, the person, and the circumstances. In Lally's study, it took anywhere from 18 days to 254 days for people to form a new habit. [Check out James Clear's site for more info](https://jamesclear.com/new-habit)
